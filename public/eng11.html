    <h3> CompostCube</h3>

			<p> One essential question in my Engineering Analysis course was "How can food waste be reduced around Pitt's campus?".
                 CompostCube is a novel idea which encourages college students to compost more by playing music as they compost. As seen in the picture on the right, 
                 sensors in the opening slot would signal the music to begin playing. After conducting interviews with multiple students, 
                 they all agreed that CompostCube would make them compost more.

    <h3> An Optimal Study Space</h3>

                For this project, everyone in our class worked in groups to design an ideal study space for college students. 
                We conducted numerous interviews to gather data on what features students would like to have in a study space. 
                We then worked as a group to create the study space pictured on the left. Our space provides a variety of seating 
                options to suit different users needs at different times. We have an ample amount of outlets to support all of the users of our space. 
                Throughout the course of this project, I learned more about the preferences of students at Pitt.
