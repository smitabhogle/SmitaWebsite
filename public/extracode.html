		<p class="margin padding">My favorite way to wind down is to
			either listen to or play music. I play the piano, drums, and guitar.
			I have been playing the piano since 3rd grade, and I picked up the
			drums and guitar in 7th grade. Right now, my favorite instrument that
			I play is the drums, however I think my parents would disagree,
			especially when I decide to to play them at 11:00PM.</p>

	<h3>Walden Journal</h3>
	<div class= "clearfix sagebackground">
	<p>Before the start of junior year, our
		summer reading assignment was to read chapters from Walden by Henry
		David Thoreau. Walden is a quintessential part of MAMS, the first
		couple weeks of Humanities focuses on this book and Thoreau. We wrote
		down our reactions to his novel in a journal over the summer, along
		with 50 vocab words.</p>

	<h3>DBQ Essay</h3>
	<div class="clearfix sagebackground">
		<p>One unit that I really enjoyed was our Satire unit. We watched
			SNL skits, read satires from different time periods, and even made
			our own satires. To end the unit, we wrote an analytical satire
			essay. My essay was about cultural appropriation.</p>
