	<h1>Advanced French</h1>

	<p class="sagebackground">
		At Mass Academy, language classes are taught by <a
			href=https://www.youtube.com/user/JWildfong>Madame Wildfong </a>. I
		took French at my previous school, so I already had a solid foundation
		in French before coming to MAMS. This is an immersion language class,
		meaning that we learn through watching movies, listening to music, and
		playing games, such as Monopoly and Clue, in French.

	<h3>French Baking!</h3>
		
	<div class="wrapper">
		<aside class="aside aside-1">
			<p>One project we recently completed was our
		French Cooking Project. Everyone chose a recipe from a French speaking
		country to make and bring into school for a pot luck. There was a
		diverse selection of foods from many different countries. I chose to
		make Bûche De Noël au Mousse au Chocolat, a French Christmas cake.
		Below is my presentation!</p>

	<h3>French Vocabulary Log</h3>
	
	<div class="wrapper">
		<aside class="aside aside-2">
			<p>Every term, one of our assignments is to
		compile a list of at least 100 French vocabulary words. The words come
		from a variety of different places: class conversations, videos, TV,
		and books. Attached below are my vocabulary terms from B Term.</p>

	<h3>French Listening Logs</h3>
	
		
			
	<div class="wrapper">
		<aside class="aside aside-1">
		<p>Another assignment we have each term is
		our Listening Logs. Each week, we listen to music or watch TV in
		French in order to immerse ourselves in modern day content and to have
		more immersion, outside of class. Watching cartoons in French is a
		nice break from more stressful assignments. This is my listening log for Semester 1.</p>
