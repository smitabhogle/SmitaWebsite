	<h1>Humanities</h1>


	<p class="sagebackground">At Mass Academy, Humanities is taught by
		Ms. Small. Humanities is a combination of an English and History
		class. The essential question of this course is "What does it mean to
		be human?" We look at a variety of different forms of literature and
		focus on how humans and society have changed throughout time. One of
		my favorite activities that we do in Humanities is class wide
		discussions. I think it's very interesting to be able to hear
		eveyone's unique perspective on different tests and topics.</p>



	<h3>DBQ Essay</h3>

		<aside class="aside aside-1">

			<p>During C Term, we all worked in groups to prepare a DBQ
				question along with sources. Then, we got to choose from any of our
				classmates' prompts to write an essay. My essay focused on the effects of tourism.</p>

	<h3>Arcadia Motif Presentation</h3>
	<div class="wrapper">

		<aside class="aside aside-2">

			<p>One of my favorite stories we read in HUM was Arcadia. This
				novel switches back and forth between two time periods, and uses
				many unique motifs in order to connect the characters actions to
				over arching themes. My group focused on the Apple and Dahlia motifs
				in the book. To the left is our presentation!</p>
