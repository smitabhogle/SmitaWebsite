	<h1>Physics</h1>

	<p class="sagebackground">

		At Mass Academy, Physics is taught by <a
			href="http://mrellis.com:8000/">Mr. Ellis </a> . Similarly, to our
		other classes, physics focuses on the process of solving a problem,
		not just the answer. Physics is a very math based science, one that
		uses math application to many real life scenarios. Most chapters
		follow the same pattern, we start off with notes about conceptual
		principles, solve end of chapter problems, and prepare for our tests
		by completing sample tests from previous years. The most important
		thing to remember for physics is to not be late to class, Mr. Ellis
		will not hesitate to lock you out of class ðŸ™ƒ

	<h3>Ãœber Rocket</h3>
	<div class="wrapper">
		
		<aside class="aside aside-1">
			<p>At the end of most units in Physics, we usually get an Ãœber
				problem. These problems are multi-step problems where almost every concept from a unit is applied. 
				Every student gets a unique numbers for their problem to encourage everyone to work through the problem more independently.   
				Attached to the right is my Calculus Ãœber Rocket write up from our first physics unit, Kinetics and Motion.</p>

			<p>One software that we often use in Physics is Microsoft Excel.
				We use it to store data and to compute calculations. The first Excel we did was
				during our kinematics and motion unit.  modeling the relationship between height and time for a rock and
				balloon. We were given the data, and created the Excels based off of
				that.</p>
