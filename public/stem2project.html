<h1>Designing a Mechanized Dog Feeder for Wheelchair Users</h1>

        <p>Our client, Client X, is a wheelchair user who expressed their
            struggles in filling their dog's food bowl. We determined that the
            problem statement of our project is that the standard process of
            providing food to dogs suing a dog bowl on a floor with the products
            on the market is ill-adapted to individuals without full use of
            their legs. We met with Client X via zoom to in order to determine
            the criteria of our project. Our project objective was to construct
            a machine for dog feeding adapted for individuals using a wheelchair
            through mechanized dispensation of dog food. Attached to the right
            is our final project presentation.</p>

<h3>Final Product</h3>

        <p>My group's preliminary design approaches included drawing many
            sketches for potential prototypes. Then, using cardboard, we made
            proof of concepts in order to determine the feasibility of our
            designs. Once our design was more solidified, I created the CAD for
            our prototype. After some time passed, we came to the conclusion
            that our initial designs were using up a lot of unneeded space and
            was over engineering a solution to the problem. This lead to many
            modifications to our design. Our final product is pictured on the
            left. 3D printed components, PVC pipes, and wood are the main
            materials used to build our project.</p>
