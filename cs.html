	<h1>Computer Science</h1>

	<p class="sagebackground">At Mass Academy, Computer Science is
		taught by Ms. Taricco. We actually made this website in her class! At
		the start of the year, we learned the basics of HTML and CSS, we all
		coded our websites using what we learned. After our websites went
		live, we started learning the programming language Java. To learn
		content, we complete notes for different topics in class. Then, we get
		a set exercises, which are like puzzles to solve by coding with the
		new content we learned. At the end of a unit, we usually have a lab as
		well. CS is also a very collaborative class, we often work together to
		work through tricky programs. By the end of junior year, we were all
		proficient in Java, and ready to begin developing mobile apps using
		Android Studio.</p>


	
	<h3>Java ArrayList Exercise</h3>

			<p>One program which is interesting is my Bulgarian Solitaire
				program. This program simulates the card game, which starts with N
				number of cards divided into random sized piles. In each round of
				the game, you take one card from each pile, forming a new pile with
				those cards. The game continues until you are left with piles of 1,
				2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 cards in any order. This program utilizes
				Java ArrayLists to simulate Bulgarian Solitaire. One of my favorite
				ways to make programming more engaging and fun is to use unique
				variable names, such as egg and ranch. Although it's not practical
				for code that is used more professionally, my peers and I had a
				great time being creative with our variable names in homework. To
				the right is my code for Bulgarian Solitaire.</p>

			<p>Another interesting program is my Sieve of Eratosthenes
				program. The objective of this program is to ask a user for a
				number, and the program identifies all the prime numbers up to that
				number. The list of numbers is then displayed in Decimal Format to
				the user. Attached to the left is my code!</p>
